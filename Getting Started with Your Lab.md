# Getting Started with your Lab Sandbox

## What tools are already installed in this environment?
- Browser Preview Extension (enables you to preview HTML and CSS within your Lab)

## How can I find my course files in Visual Studio Code?
- After opening the lab for the first time or if you have   
  not used it for a while, it opens to a blank IDE.   
  If this is the case, click on the **Explore** icon on the left   
  column (the one that looks like two sheets of paper stacked   
  together). Then, click on the **Open Folder** button.   
  In the list that appears, select **project** and click **OK**. 
  Your files will be stored in "home/coder/project".
     
## How can I preview my HTML code with the browser preview extension?  
1. With your HTML file open in the editor, right click and select   
  **Open with Live Server**. There will be a message in the   
  lower right corner stating that the server is started at port 5500.  

2. Now, go to the icon tool bar on the left side of the screen and   
  select **Browser Preview** (it should be the last icon   
  on the bottom). A mini browser will open, in the address bar,   
  type **localhost:5500/[path to your file]**  
  (for example: **localhost:5500/index.html**), then hit enter.  

3. As long as you keep the live server running and the mini   
  browser open, you will see your changes reflected in the   
  mini broswer in real time.  

### How can I leverage the debugger tool?
- More information on this can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging 

### How can I use the terminal?
- More information on using the VSCode integrated terminal can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal 

## Additional Course Specific Notes:

### Are console logs available to help me troubleshoot my web development work?
- The embedded VSCode Browser Preview tool does not support viewing of browser  
  console logs. However, you can use your standard browser inspect element tool to  
  investigate page elements in your web applications.  

### Why am I getting errors in my lab when trying to access other websites?
- This Lab Sandbox environment does not have   
  access to outside websites. Similarly, font-awesome, hyperlinks and   
  external image and media links will not work in the lab sandbox.  
  To access these sites, please open these links in a new tab in your 
  web browser (outside of your lab).
